## About My Project
The ePortfolio Management System is a Java-based project that allows users to manage their investment portfolio. Designed as a hands-on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project, it enables users to buy, sell, update, and track investments like stocks and mutual funds, as well as calculate total gains. The system provides a comprehensive way for users to interact with their financial portfolio through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Built as part of my Year 2 OOP coursework, this project incorporates advanced features such as HashMap indexing for faster searches and file I/O to save and reload portfolios, showcasing my proficiency with Java and GUI development.

<br/>

## üöÄ Features

- **Buy and Sell Investments:** Users can add or sell stocks and mutual funds to maintain their financial portfolio.
- **Update Prices:** Ability to update investment prices, ensuring the portfolio reflects current market conditions.
- **Search Investments:** Fast and intuitive search using HashMaps for keyword and criteria-based filtering.
- **Total Gain Calculation:** Calculate and display the total gain from all investments, giving users a clear view of their financial performance.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Built using Java Swing, the system provides a clean, intuitive interface to manage investments.

## üíª Tech Used

This program uses:

- **Java:** The core programming language used to build the portfolio management logic.
- **Java Swing:** Used to create the Graphical User Interface for user interaction.
- **Object-Oriented Principles:** Features like inheritance and polymorphism are utilized to create the `Investment` superclass and its subclasses (`Stock` and `MutualFund`).
- **HashMap:** Used for efficient searching of investments.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Build the Program**
    - Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
    - Navigate to the root folder of the program and compile using:
      ```sh
      javac -d bin ePortfolio/*.java
      ```
    - This command compiles all Java files and places the compiled output into the `bin` directory.

2. **Run the Program**
    - Start the application using the following command from the root folder:
      ```sh
      java -cp bin ePortfolio.ePortfolio
      ```
    - This command will launch the ePortfolio Management System.

3. **Clean the Program**
    - To clean the compiled files, run the following command:
      ```sh
      rm -rf bin/*
      ```

4. **Generate Javadoc**
    - You can generate the program's documentation using:
      ```sh
      javadoc -d a3doc ePortfolio
      ```
    - The generated Javadoc will be saved in the `a3doc` folder.
